description: Complete OpenRCA Root Cause Analysis Pipeline from Environment Setup to Evaluation
repository: OpenRCA
purpose: |
  Convert the OpenRCA repository into a modular, reproducible pipeline for:
  - Evaluating LLMs' root cause analysis capabilities
  - Processing telemetry data (metrics, traces, logs) 
  - Running RCA-agent and baseline models
  - Generating comprehensive evaluation reports
